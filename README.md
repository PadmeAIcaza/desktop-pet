A desktop virtual cat that helps you stay on top of your daily schedule.

DesktopCat is a Python desktop application that combines a lightweight virtual pet with a personal task manager. Instead of being just a decorative desktop pet, the cat actively reminds you of upcoming tasks, lets you manage your schedule through a simple interface, and can optionally integrate with a local AI assistant for natural conversations.
